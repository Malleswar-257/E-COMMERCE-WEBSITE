Impact Analysis:

  "content": "# PROJECT SUMMARY\n\nThe given repository is a frontend implementation of a hotel booking UI design, built using TypeScript and Vite. The architecture document appears to be a PDF generated by ReportLab, which is not directly related to the frontend code. However, based on the frontend code and architecture, we can infer that the project is a web application for hotel booking, which will require a robust backend to handle user authentication, booking management, and data storage.\n\n# TECHNICAL ANALYSIS\n\n## 1. Frontend tech stack analysis\n\n* The frontend is built using TypeScript and Vite.\n* The UI is designed using React (tsx files).\n* The project uses a simple HTML file (index.html) as the entry point.\n\n## 2. Backend framework recommendation\n\nBased on the frontend tech stack, I recommend using a Node.js-based backend framework such as Express.js or Next.js. Both frameworks are well-suited for building RESTful APIs and have excellent support for TypeScript.\n\n## 3. Database choice with reasoning\n\nI recommend using a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL for this project. The hotel booking application will require storing complex data such as user information, booking details, and hotel information, which can be efficiently managed using a relational database.\n\n## 4. API architecture (REST/GraphQL)\n\nI recommend using a RESTful API architecture for this project. REST is a well-established and widely adopted architecture style that is easy to implement and understand. GraphQL can be used for specific use cases such as querying hotel information, but REST is a better fit for the overall architecture.\n\n## 5. Authentication strategy\n\nI recommend using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. JWT is a widely adopted standard for token-based authentication that can be easily implemented using Node.js and Express.js.\n\n## 6. Integration approach\n\nTo integrate the frontend with the backend, I recommend using a RESTful API approach. The frontend can make HTTP requests to the backend API to retrieve and update data. The backend can use a library such as Axios to handle HTTP requests and responses.\n\n## 7. Deployment recommendations\n\nI recommend deploying the application using a containerization platform such as Docker and a cloud platform such as AWS or Google Cloud. This will provide a scalable and secure deployment environment for the application.\n\n# DATABASE SCHEMA DESIGN\n\nBased on the architecture requirements, I design the following database tables:\n\n**Users**\n\n| Field Name | Data Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| id | int | Unique user ID |\n| name | varchar(255) | User name |\n| email | varchar(255) | User email |\n| password | varchar(255) | User password (hashed) |\n| role | enum('admin', 'user') | User role |\n\n**Hotels**\n\n| Field Name | Data Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| id | int | Unique hotel ID |\n| name | varchar(255) | Hotel name |\n| address | varchar(255) | Hotel address |\n| phone | varchar(20) | Hotel phone number |\n| email | varchar(255) | Hotel email |\n\n**Bookings**\n\n| Field Name | Data Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| id | int | Unique booking ID |\n| user_id | int | Foreign key referencing the Users table |\n| hotel_id | int | Foreign key referencing the Hotels table |\n| check_in | date | Booking check-in date |\n| check_out | date | Booking check-out date |\n| status | enum('pending', 'confirmed', 'cancelled') | Booking status |\n\n**Indexes**\n\n* Create an index on the Users table for the email field.\n* Create an index on the Hotels table for the name field.\n* Create an index on the Bookings table for the user_id and hotel_id fields.\n\n# RECOMMENDED API ENDPOINTS\n\nBased on the architecture requirements, I suggest the following API endpoints:\n\n**Users**\n\n* `POST /users`: Create a new user.\n* `GET /users`: Retrieve a list of all users.\n* `GET /users/:id`: Retrieve a specific user by ID.\n* `PUT /users/:id`: Update a specific user by ID.\n* `DELETE /users/:id`: Delete a specific user by ID.\n\n**Hotels**\n\n* `POST /hotels`: Create a new hotel.\n* `GET /hotels`: Retrieve a list of all hotels.\n* `GET /hotels/:id`: Retrieve a specific hotel by ID.\n* `PUT /hotels/:id`: Update a specific hotel by ID.\n* `DELETE /hotels/:id`: Delete a specific hotel by ID.\n\n**Bookings**\n\n* `POST /bookings`: Create a new booking.\n* `GET /bookings`: Retrieve a list of all bookings.\n* `GET /bookings/:id`: Retrieve a specific booking by ID.\n* `PUT /bookings/:id`: Update a specific booking by ID.\n* `DELETE /bookings/:id`: Delete a specific booking by ID.\n\n**Authentication**\n\n* `POST /login`: Authenticate a user and return a JWT token.\n* `GET /logout`: Invalidate a JWT token and log out the user.\n\nNote: This is a basic design and may need to be modified based on the specific requirements of the project."
